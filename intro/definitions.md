## What is GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call. Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.


## Why GraphQL

### Single API Call

### Overfetching / Underfetching

### Type Checking & Introspection

## GraphQL Query

## GraphQL Mutation
