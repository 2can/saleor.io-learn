description: Build a high performaing ecommerce Storefront

Saleor is a GraphQL API that provides the backend for your frontend applications. Such frontend application can be a web application, a mobile app, or anything else that can communicate over the HTTP protocol. In this tutorial we will be using Next.js, a React.js framework for building web applications. 

In e-commerce, frontend applications are also known as storefronts, because they provide the actual fronts for your applications. 
In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through how to set up your own Saleor storefront. Feel free to go section by section or hop around to the sections most relevant to your needs.
