The product pricing is not only about the range of prices of its variants, but it also contains the information about the possible discounts, sales and taxes.

The prices in Saleor are not represented as the number values, but as structures containing the amount along with the currency and in some cases the tax information so that you can access the gross, net and just the tax value for a given product.
