At this point we have configured all the nuts and bolts so that we have a base for building e-commerce applications with Next.js & Saleor using TypeScript.

Saleor provides the `create-storefront` application wizard that teleports you directly to this point by generating everything that was described in the setup section.

Use it with `npx`:

```
npx create-storefront react-storefront
```
```
pnpm dlx create-storefront react-storefront
```
